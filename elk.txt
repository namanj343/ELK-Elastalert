Installing elastalert On ELK stack for sending alert on  slack/gmail:
>Need to install python 3.6 version even python2.7 is install or not using:
1.1.apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev  
----
>Install elastalert repo to install elastalert:
2.git clone https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert.git
----
>Install the module:
3.pip3 install "setuptools>=11.3"
3.2.pip3 install pyOpenSSL (for securly installing setup.py file
3.3. python3 setup.py install
------
4. Install elasticSearch:
pip3 install "elasticsearch>=5.0.0"
----
5. Setup ElasticSearch:
 elastalert-create-index
Note: At the time of running a "elastalert" error make occur which is b/c of package missing:
Like:pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'jira>=2.0.0' distribution was not found and is required by elastalert
Whcih means jira version 2.0.0 need to be download using >pip3 install "jira>=2.0.0"
Similarly many error occur in my case so run bellow commands to install the required package like:
..pip3 install jsonschema>=3.0.2
..pip3 install six==1.11.0	
..pip3 install oauthlib>==3.0.0
..pip3 install "PyYAML>=3.12"   ..........................
------
6. Once the missing package error finishes the run bellow command for testing the alerts:
elastalert-test-rule --config config.yaml example_rules/example_frequency.yaml
Note: In the example_frequency.yaml file we have created a yaml script in which we rules is defined for which condition we are going to alerted and with the time range our alert will be check.
Note: in the config.yaml file:
i. We will define the root folder for alert file like our case root folder was example_rules.
ii. We have defined that alert will be check for every min.
iii.Then hostname along with port.   
---
7. Now fr the last we will the elastAlert
python3 -m elastalert.elasalert --verbose --rule example_rules/example_frequency.yaml
Now: Whenever the frequency of alert will match alert will be send.
